            I imagine a new ERC-20 geth ethereum network store token allows the
            developer to make new tokens upon a lost private key. Is “printing
            currency” ever disabled by a certain token, or am I wrong about this
            trust-bearing genesis block developer capability?

          <br />I did more reading and found a read-only token interface with
          ERC/EIP-1155. Is a plausible improvement proposal to take supply
          generation off-schedule? Can the retired supply records (then) also be
          shared in-network? If that’s impossible, what should I look out for in
          providing my users security of their local private keys, but
          recovering their account as many times as they please? Should I go to
          sleep with my thumb on the 9 for the genesis block’s Wei balance?
